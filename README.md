# NeurAIGraph: A Neurosymbolic AI System for Knowledge Graph Generation and Visualization

## Overview

NeurAIGraph is a cutting-edge artificial intelligence system that combines the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and advanced 3D visualization techniques to create, analyze, and represent complex knowledge graphs. This system is designed to extract semantic information and relationships from text, embed them in multidimensional spaces, and provide intuitive visual representations of ontologies and ground truth.

## Key Features

- **Local LLM Integration**: Utilizes a carefully selected, efficient language model for semantic extraction, optimized for performance on high-end consumer hardware.
- **Graph Neural Network Processing**: Employs state-of-the-art GNN architectures to process and enrich the extracted knowledge graphs.
- **3D Visualization Interface**: Features a custom-built 3D rendering engine for intuitive exploration of complex knowledge structures.
- **Neurosymbolic Architecture**: Bridges the gap between symbolic AI and neural networks, enabling more robust and interpretable AI systems.
- **Ontology Embedding**: Implements novel techniques for embedding ontologies in multidimensional spaces, enhancing the system's ability to represent and reason about complex relationships.

## Technical Stack

- **Language Model**: [Specific LLM to be determined based on performance requirements]
- **Graph Processing**: PyTorch Geometric
- **Visualization**: Three.js / WebGL
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
